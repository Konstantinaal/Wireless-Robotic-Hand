# Wireless Robotic Hand with Flex Sensor Glove

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis in Biomedical Engineering. It is a wireless robotic hand controlled by flex sensors mounted on a glove, using two Arduino UNOs and NRF24L01 modules for communication.

## 🧠 Project Summary
- **Thesis Title**: Wireless Robotic Hand with Arduino
- **Objective**: To build a low-cost, wireless robotic hand for assistive or rehabilitation purposes.
- **Control System**: Flex sensors on glove → Transmitter Arduino → NRF24L01 → Receiver Arduino → Servo-controlled robotic fingers.

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- 2 × Arduino UNO
- 4 × MG996R Servo Motors
- 4 × Flex Sensors
- 2 × NRF24L01 Wireless Modules
